# Goals of an Operating System

Operating system is primarility a resource manager. It is the authority that sits between hardware and end user. The following are the primary goals of an operating system

* Convenience - In any computing system, we will have a set of hardware. For example, in any computer, we have processor, memory, disk, I/O devices etc. If use has to access the functionalities of hardware for their own purpose they need to write program to access the resources for each time. Say a user wants to print a file, then to print the user need to write program and ask the printer to print all characters. This is very inconvenient for user. So, operating system sits in between user and hardware and provides the convenient way to access the hardware functionalities in terms of system call.

* Throughput - It is the amount of work done in a unit amount of time. Larger the troughput more efficient the system is. One of the primary responsibility of the operating system is to maxiize throuput keeping the convenience intact. With every generation of operating system the throughput provided by the operating system is increasing and the systems are becoming more efficient. 

* Security - Operating system's one major role is to provide security to the processes. In multi programming environment, multiple processes are loaded in the primary memory at a time to increase the degree of multiprogramming. Operating system needs to ensure that one process do not access or overwite the memory allocated for a different process.
